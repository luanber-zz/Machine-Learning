# hello-world
*edit 1: I'm learning how to edit files and create branchs! Maybe I'll merge this in the master soon...
This depository was created with basis in the github starter tutorial! I hope I can make something util here.... and, 100% sure, I expect to see good people work!!
I know a little little bit about higher level languages such as python, js, html .-.
I can understand the "logical" of other languages, too -maybe- o.o
I'm interested in learning and, if I get this good, develop things in Neural Networks\Machine Learning and in Blockchain Technology\Protocols of com.
